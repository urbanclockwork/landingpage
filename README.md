# landingpage
This is my first real suedo webpage that is supposed to be a landing page.
I'm not going to lie, this was very difficult for me to accomplish and took me a long to time to complete,
and not only that but the code is very messy and inefficient.
That being said though, I'll be damned if I didn't learn a heck of a lot while doing this. However my goal for this project wasn't eligant design
but to make a basic structured and somewhat responsive(i.e. the links change when hovering over and the page reacts to widening/shorting.)
webpage. I know there is quite a bit I got wrong but each time I do a challenging project like this, I have to reflect to realize how
much I've actually learned(which is a lot!).
